# BluetoothEspresso
a bluetooth espresso machine

Purpose:  To PID enable a mid-level pump espresso machine and add a timer for pulling shots.

I am using an arduino outfitted with an atmega328.  A thermocouple, BTmodule, Solidstate Relay, and a mechanical relay will be used.
I decided Bluetooth, don't want a russian hacker making espresso on my machine. 

Whats needed:
Schematics, PID enabled, Testing, Android testing, Modularize is a possibility for an array for many machines, shot counter, syrup/sugar despenser
